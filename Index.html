            <p>One of my hobby`s is are gammeing.
            i really love the imagination ppl have to put in too thos games. 
            Another hobby of mine i music.
            I do lisen to music alot and it`s alot of diffrend type of music,
            alot of them are music from games i love how a simpel,
            sound can capture your own imagination,
            if u never heard or seen where its from.
            My third little hobby is fishing,
            i really love fishing where i live its not to far form a lake,
            and its a place not to far from where i live.
            My fourth littl hobby i would say its two things that take that spot for me,
            one of them is coloring drawings is super relexing and i can just zone out complitly,
            second one is i like painting warhammer figures,
             it can sometimes be demending on consentrasion,
            specialy when u sit with a toothe picker to get paint on the smallest part.
